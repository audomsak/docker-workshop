# Docker Workshop

Containers are the future of highly-scalable software systems and have cost and runtime efficient supporting infrastructure. But learning it might look complex as it comes with many technicalities. This is where The Docker Workshop will help you.

Through this workshop, youâ€™ll quickly learn how to work with containers and Docker with the help of practical activities.

Please note that, some of lab instructions contain both [solo and management commands](https://blog.couchbase.com/docker-1-13-management-commands/). Both types of commands do the same things so you can choose one over the other as you like. The intention of having both types of commands in the lab is to let you be aware of and familiar with them.
